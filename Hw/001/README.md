# Your Task

Edit the file run.m and read the instructions within.
The `run.m` file is called a *script*.
It has the extension `.m` because it is a *Matlab* file.
Scripts contain sequences of Matlab commands.
You can execute the script by typing *run* at the command line
(if the name of the script was `banana.m` you would type *banana*).
When you first download this assignment and execute *run*, the result
will look like this.

```matlab
>> run
>>
```

That is, nothing will happen.
When you have followed the instructions in `run.m` (and save!) the
result will look like this.

```matlab
>> run

x =

     1

>> 
```

Awesome!

This exercise is easy enough that you could probably just edit run.m on GitHub and never test it on Matlab,
but that is not the point of the exercise! The point is for you to figure out a workflow that works for you.

The most straightforward, at least in the short term, is the following.
    
1. At the top of the GitHub page, you should be able to see
`bmccary/16f-math-2370-USERNAME` (where USERNAME is your
GitHub username). When you click on `16f-MATH-2370-USERNAME`
you will go to the top-level of the repository.
Why don't you right-click it an open it new tab so you
can continue reading these instructions?
  
2. There is a big green button called *Clone or Download*.
Click it and you will see *Download ZIP*. Click that and
you will be prompted to download a ZIP file. Save it.

3. Now unzip that ZIP file in a suitable place. It doesn't
matter where you unzip it because you'll just delete it later.
You now have a local copy of your GitHub repository.

4. Start up Matlab and figure out how to change directories
into wherever you unzipped that ZIP file and then change
into the directory `hw/001`.

5. You can now type *run* at the Matlab command line and
watch nothing happen (as expected). Edit the `run.m` file 
as described and run it again to watch the right thing happen.

6. On GitHub, go to your repository and to `hw/001`. You'll
see a button called *Upload Files*. Click it and then follow
the instructions to upload your `run.m` file.

7. So, you downloaded some files from GitHub, edited them
and the uploaded your changes. Terrific!

8. You can delete the files you unzipped because you're
finished with them now (you could always get them again by
doing the above procedure again).
     
You did it!
