# Your Task

Your task to implement a better version of the guess-the-number function in `play_iterative.m`.
The current version guesses linearly (It it 1? Is it 2? Is it 3? ...), but it is possible to do better.

This questions is exactly the same as `hw/010`, except now your implementation needs to be iterative
(not recursive).

# Validation Testing

The validation script for this homework is `test.m`.
Your edits will be correct when:

```
>> test
Running test_cases
...
Done test_cases
__________

>> 
```
I.e., when there are no errors.

# Grading

Your work will be graded by the validation test. 
So be sure to check the output of *test*.
