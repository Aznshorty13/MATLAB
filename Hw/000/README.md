# Welcome to MATH 2370

This file is written [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
(which is why the extension is .md). The name *Markdown* is a play on the word *Markup*
which is the usual name for languages in which documents are styled (e.g., most webpages are formatted
using HTML -- hyper-text *markup* language). You'll find programming is full of such wordplay.

Your first homework assignment is to edit this file to correct the title and make it say 
welcome to the correct course. Please make no other edits. You don't even need to download 
this file, you can edit it directly on GitHub by clicking the pencil-looking icon in the top-right.
