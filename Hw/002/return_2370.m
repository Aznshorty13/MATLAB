    %    |   |          |
    %    |   |          The function takes no arguments

    %    |   |
    %    |   The function's name is "return_2370".

    %    The function returns a single value called "a".

    % This function is always supposed to return the value 2370,
    % but it is currently always returning 0, so it's broken. 
    % Please fix it!
