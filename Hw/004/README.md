# Your Task

This exercise is very similar to `003`.
The new element is that the function returns *two* values instead of one.
Edit the file `butterfly_2370.m` and read the instructions within.

# Validation Testing

The validation script for this homework is `test.m`.
Your edits to `butterfly_2370.m` will be correct when:
```
>> [x, y] = butterfly_2370(8)

x =

        2378


y =

       -2362

>> test
Running test_cases
.
Done test_cases
__________

>> 
```

# Grading

Your work will be graded by the validation test. 
So be sure to check the output of *test*.
